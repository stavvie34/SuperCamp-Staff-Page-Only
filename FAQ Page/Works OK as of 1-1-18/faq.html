                        <p> The HR Operations Department will make every effort to ensure that staff members are placed at their desired sites, however it cannot be guaranteed. Our goal with placement is to create well balanced teams with a variety of experience levels in order to create a successful experience for all staff. To do this, we maintain a proactive approach that sets both sides up with a reasonable timeline to get you materials, training, and adequate time to prepare. Three factors that affect placement are as follows:</p>
                        <p class="bold" style="margin-top: 10px;">1. Flexibility with your Availability</p>
                        <p>- more availability for longer periods of time that align with the calendar. This allows us to run several scenarios for your placement. Although we would like to work with your interest in mind as well, submitting your availability for only the sites you are interested may limit your placement options.</p>
                        <p class="bold" style="margin-top: 10px;">2. Level of Experience</p>
                        <p>- this refers to the number of camps you have worked with consistent growth and feedback on your evaluations. This allows us to place staff with a variety of skill level with you at site. Think coaching and mentorship, levels of ability and experience in your position, and who your position interacts with.</p>
                        <p class="bold" style="margin-top: 10px;"><br>3. Knowledge of our Curriculum</p>
                        <p>(Facilitators and Senior Team Leaders) - your familiarity and level of depth of knowledge both in main room and academic curriculum, preparation history (do you know our material in a timely manner) determines if we can give you new curriculum, or have different levels of mastery at one site collaborating.</p>

Team Leaders (aka Camp Counselors) will participate in three days of staff training prior to the arrival of campers. This on-site training will answer many of the questions that exist for new staff members. All other roles (sans Team Leaders) will participate in conference calls in conjunction with their manual. Site Counselors, Site Administrators, Lead Facilitators, and Facilitators will all attend in-person trainings at QLNs headquarters in addition to receiving their manual and participating in conference calls.

Prices for these permits vary depending on the campus. Quantum Learning Network is not responsible for any parking fines received by staff members. Staff members who choose to bring their vehicles are not permitted to use them for SuperCamp purposes, including transporting campers. Staff members who drive with another staff member in their own vehicle do so at their own risk.</p>
